## Bootcamp Project 2
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a full-stack application that works with real-world data to solve a real-
world challenge. Even more than your first group project, this project will provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which 
employers will want to see when you begin to interview for development roles. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you 
create, but your project must fulfill some specific requirements.

The requirements for this project ask you to use the skills and technologies you’ve learned over the past six weeks (server-side JavaScript, RESTful APIs, 
databases, object-relational mapping, environment variables, templating, and authentication).

You’ll also have to use some of the more conceptual skills you’ve picked up and think like a developer. MySQL isn’t the only relational database management system. 
Sequelize isn’t the only ORM. And Handlebars.js isn’t the only templating engine. As a developer, you’ll have to jump in and learn new technologies at a moment’s 
notice, digging into the documentation and learning to make new things work with your code. That’s why you should integrate at least one new library, package, or 
technology that we haven’t discussed in this course into your application
